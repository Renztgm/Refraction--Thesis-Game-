	"description": " The encounter with the Shadow has left you shaken and weary. Though it faded away before a true battle could begin, its presence lingers in your mind like a dark omen. Your companion sees the toll this brief meeting has taken on you and suggests finding a place to rest. You need sleep to process what you've witnessed and gather strength for whatever lies ahead. The Shadow's appearance was no coincidence—something darker is stirring.",
